# wind-field-simulation
A fast and accurate simulation framework for the simulation of nonstationary wind fields


# Code is being cleaned and will be uploaded soon

# Pending Features
Export model
Support for multiple sklearn SVM models
Visualization for models with more than 2 features

Fell free to open an issue if more features are needed
